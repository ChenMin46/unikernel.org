I am pleased to announce that my FREE Unikernel eBook is now available
from O'Reilly.

I have been giving talks about Unikernels for the past 2 years at
conferences throughout the North America.  This eBook is my attempt to
present most of the information from these talks in a written form.
It is not a technical HowTo book, but rather an introduction to the
basic concept of Unikernels and an explanation of their value.

I hope this eBook will be a useful tool for introducing people to the
whys and wherefores of Unikernels.
