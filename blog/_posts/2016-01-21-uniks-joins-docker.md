Today, [Unikernel Systems][uniks] announced that it is joining Docker. Please
read the main notice posted at [unikernel.com][uniks] and the Docker
blog post at [http://blog.docker.com/2016/01/unikernel/][docker-pr].

An important part of the work of Unikernel Systems is to support the growing
unikernel movement, which includes contributing to a number of open source
projects as well as supporting this community website, [unikernel.org][]. The
Unikernel Systems team will continue this work.

Through further interaction with the Docker project and community, the open
source unikernel community will receive increased visibility and contributions
which will accelerate the adoption of unikernels.
